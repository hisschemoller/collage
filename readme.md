# Collage App

This application generates photo collages, compositions of each time three randomly chosen images.

It is a Node.js web application that loads images from directories on the local file system and shows the generated collage on a canvas element in the browser.

## Requirements

* A modern web browser
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), I have 8.0.0 installed, but older ones might work just as fine.
